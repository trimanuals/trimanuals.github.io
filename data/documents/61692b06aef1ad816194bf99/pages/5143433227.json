Refer to the 'Keyless ECM Calibration - Failed Download Recovery Flow Chart' provided in the Service Manual.","Instruments Calibration Download","The instrument calibration has a large file size and may include updates to the instrument graphics. It can take up to 40 minutes for the TFT instrument downloads to complete.","During the instrument download, the diagnostic tool will check if the instruments have a valid VIN stored. ","If the instruments do not have a valid VIN stored, the diagnostic software will automatically read the VIN from the Engine ECM and program it into the Instruments. The engine stop switch must be in the RUN position to allow the diagnostic tool to communicate with the Engine ECM.","There may be a short delay at the start of the download while this function is carried out. During this delay the download progress bar will remain at 0%. The download progress bar will begin to advance when the VIN check function is complete.","If a valid VIN cannot be obtained from the Engine ECM, you will be prompted to manually enter the motorcycle's 17 digit VIN. The manually entered VIN will then be programmed to the instruments before the download process is completed.","During the download, the instrument display will turn off and the red immobiliser/alarm LED will flash.","Multiple files are transferred during the download. The progress bar displayed on the diagnostic tool may repeatedly rise from 0% to 100% as each file is downloaded.","Do not assume the download has completed when the instrument display turns back on.
