When pulling the brake lever or pushing the caliper pistons in, some resistance should be felt indicating that the screw is not opened too much.","Partially open the bleed screw.","Pressure applied to the brake pedal during the brake fluid renew process must be applied and removed smoothly and slowly. It must take a minimum of five seconds between lever positions (from fully released to stop).","Failure to do this slowly can allow air to be drawn in to the system through the bleed screw threads.","Get an assistant to slowly depress the brake pedal and then slowly release the brake lever.","Repeat step 9 until fresh brake fluid appears in the bleed tube.","When fresh brake fluid is in the system, apply pressure to the brake pedal, close the bleed screw and tighten it to ","6 Nm",".","Remove the bleed tube and replace the bleed screw cap.","Slide the caliper onto the disc, ensuring the pads pass either side of the disc, fit the fixings and tighten the upper fixing to ","24 Nm"," and the lower fixing to ","29 Nm",".","Refit the reservoir cap ensuring that the diaphragm seal is correctly positioned between the cap and the reservoir body. Tighten the fixings to ","1 Nm",".","Check the operation of the rear brake. Rectify as necessary.","Refit the front sprocket cover (see ","Front Sprocket Cover - Installation",").","It is dangerous to operate the motorcycle with defective brakes; you must have your authorised Triumph dealer take remedial action before you attempt to ride the motorcycle again. Failure to take remedial action may reduce braking efficiency leading to loss of motorcycle control and an accident."],"viewCount":0,"infoType":"InfoType02","createdAt":"2024-06-12T07:36:29.350Z","updatedAt":"2024-06-12T07:36:29.350Z","__v":0}
